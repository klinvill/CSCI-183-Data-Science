# CSCI-183-Data-Science
Repo to hold the coursework I did for my CSCI 183 Data Science class

#### HW 1
Exploratory Data Analysis exercise from the OReilly book ["Doing Data Science" by Cathy O'Neil and Rachel Schutt] (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028529.do)

#### HW 2
[Titanic Kaggle Competition] (http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted) using Logistic Regression

#### Expedia Activity
Class competition to predict what users will purchase using ratings and competitive price information

#### Class Activity 1
Brief analysis of Bike Theft Data at Santa Clara University to find the dorm, day of week, and month of year that bike thefts occur the most at SCU

#### Class Activity 2
[Titanic Kaggle Competition] (http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted) using Boosting and Decision Trees

#### Music Clustering Activity
Music clustering using Principal Component Analysis

#### Soil pH Modeling with LASSO
Soil pH modeling using ground sensor data and LASSO Penalized Regression

#### General Social Survey Political Views
Brief visualization of Americans' Political Views based on two representative issues (Gay Marriage and Wealth Distribution). This visualization is modeled after the graphic at [fivethirtyeight] (http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/there-are-few-libertarians-but-many-americans-have-libertarian-views/)

#### Galaxy Prediction
In-class competition based on the [Galxy Zoo Kaggle Competition] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge). My best result used an autoencoder to generate features from the images and then built a random forest model on those features. Disclaimer: the code for the autoencoder was largely written by the Professor of the course, George Mohler.
